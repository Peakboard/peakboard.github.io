Peakboard offers a font manager for managing fonts and formats. In the upper part of the Peakboard-Designer, go to the Format tab. Click here on the button Fonts. A new window will open, listing all available fonts.

You can edit, copy or remove a font using the corresponding button.

To create a new font, click the Add button.
A new window opens in which you can adjust the font and confirm with OK.
