The Radio Button Control can be found under the Input Controls in the Controls list. 
The Radio Button works analogous to the [Toggle Button](/controls/en-togglebutton.html).
Two scripts can be created which are executed when the radio button is activated 'Checked' or deactivated 'Unchecked'.

Further information on how to create scripts or how the [Script-Editor](/scripting/de-script-editor.html) works can be found in the Scripting section.
