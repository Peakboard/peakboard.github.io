You can use the Tableau View Control element to display tableau views on the Peakboard. The Tabelau View is located on a tableau server and is also rendered there. Peakboard serves as a display.

In order for Peakboard to gain access to the Tableau Server, you must set the IP address of Peakboard on the server as “Trusted”:

1. On the Tableau Server, start the Tableau console window as administrator. The console window can be found in **C: \Program Files\Tableau\Tableau Server\9.2\bin**

2. Execute the following commands:

```
tab admin stop
tabadmin set wgserver. trusted_hosts “<IP address of Peakboard >”
tabadmin config
tab admin start
```

More information can be found at: [http://onlinehelp.tableau.com/current/server/en-us/trusted_auth.htm](http://onlinehelp.tableau.com/current/server/en-us/trusted_auth.htm)
In the Tableau View Control, the following options must be filled in the properties window:

**Server:** IP address of the tableau server
**Username:** Name of the user on the tableau server
**Workbook:** Name of the tableau workbook containing the view.
**View:** The name of the view you want to display on the Peakboard

The following two pictures show an original tableau dashboard on the tableau server and the representation on a Peakboard panel.
