PDFs can be integrated into the visualization via the Control PDF Viewer. 
This control is located under the menu item Document in the Controls list, or is automatically created when a PDF file is dragged from the resources onto the screen.

How to control a PDF with a script can be found [here](https://templates.peakboard.com/Script-Example-PDF-Page-Change/en).
