Using the item Photo Frame several pictures can be displayed in a slide show in the visualization. 
This control can be found under the Media tab in the Controls list. 
The images can either be dragged and dropped into the Photo Frame or selected in the control's properties using the Data Source item.
The order of the images can also be defined here. 
The item Loading Interval, which can also be found in the properties, determines the display duration of the individual screens.
