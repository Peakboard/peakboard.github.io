The Image control is located on the Media tab in the Controls list or is created automatically when an image is dragged from the resources to the drawing area. 
In addition to the [general properties](/controls/en-general-properties.html), three events can also be created for the Control: 
* A tapped event triggered by simply clicking on the image 
* a Right Tapped Event, which is triggered by a right click on the image, and 
* a Double Tapped Event that is triggered by double-clicking on the image on a touchscreen or mouse.

How to create [scripts](/scripting/en-script-engine.html) can be found in the section "Scripting".
