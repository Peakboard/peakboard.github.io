The Video Control is located on the Media tab in the Controls list or is created automatically when a video is dragged from the Resources to the screen. 
In the Control Properties, you can specify, in addition to the [general properties](/controls/en-general-properties.html), whether the Control should be played in an infinite loop or only once.

In addition, the control can be addressed by script, provided that it has been assigned a name via the properties. The following commands are available:

* Start(): Starts the video
* Pause(): Pauses the video
* Restart(): Starts the video from the beginning
