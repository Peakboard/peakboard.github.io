The Live Tile Box can be used to create separate tiles, similar to the [Tile Control](https://help.peakboard.com/controls/de-tilecontrol.html).
These can then be displayed in a specific order or under specific conditions. 
The control can be dragged and dropped onto the drawing area.
Double-clicking or clicking the button next to Data/Tiles in the Properties opens the Live Tile Box editing screen. 
In the Live Tile Box, new tiles can be created and existing tiles can be edited. 
A second drawing area is available in this mask in which a selection of controls can be inserted. 
After the tiles for the Live Tile Box have been created, you only have to define in the properties in which intervals the tiles should be displayed.
