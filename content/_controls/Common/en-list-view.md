In the ListView, a design for each row of a data source is displayed using a defined template.
This is particularly suitable if repetitive contents are to be displayed identically.
The behavior of the ListView control is very similar to the [Tile Control](/controls/14-en-tilecontrol.html) and the [Tile View](/controls/11-en-tile-view.html).
A template must be defined for the display of the individual elements.
How to create a template for the ListView or TileView control is explained step by step in [Tile Control](/controls/14-en-tilecontrol.html).

The elements can be arranged vertically or horizontally. The setting for this is made under Orientation, where the desired orientation can be set using a dropdown list. It is also possible to change the template using the ListView control on the basis of a rule that has been made. The data in the following list is used for this.

With the ListView, the data is displayed in the form of rows. To display the elements as tiles, the [Tile View](/controls/common/en-tile-view.html) can be used.
