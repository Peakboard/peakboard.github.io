You can use the icon control to integrate different icons into the visualization.
Like any other control, you drag and drop the icon control onto the surface.
You can select the desired icon by double-clicking on the automatically inserted standard icon or via the [Select icon] button in the [Appearance] area in the attributes.

The icon dialog that opens allows you to search for a suitable icon.
You can use the search function to search for keywords. Alternatively you can search by the different categories in the left pane.

Use the two color selection fields [Color 1] and [Color 2] in the upper area to select a primary and secondary color, if desired. With OK you confirm the selection.

If you want to display a different icon under certain conditions (for example a warning icon in case of a machine failure), you can select this in the [Logic] area in the attributes under [Conditional formatting].
How conditional formatting works is explained in [this article](/controls/en-cf.html).
