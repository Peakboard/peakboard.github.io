In the TileView, a design for each row of a data source is displayed using a defined template. 
This is particularly suitable if repetitive contents are to be displayed identically.
The behavior of the TileView control is very similar to the [Tile Control](/controls/Common/en-tilecontrol.html) and the [ListView-Control](/controls/10-en-list-view.html).
A template must be defined for the display of the individual elements. The [Tile Control](/controls/Common/en-tilecontrol.html) explains step by step how to create a template for the TileView control.


The TileView is displayed in the form of tiles. To display the elements as a list, the [List View](/controls/Common/en-list-view.html) can be used.
