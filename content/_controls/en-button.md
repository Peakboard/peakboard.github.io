The button is located at the top of the Input Controls. 
If it is integrated in a visualization and clicked on using a touchscreen or mouse, it executes one script per click. 
This can be created in the properties under Events and then Tapped or by double-clicking the button in the Designer.

Further information on how to create scripts or how the [Script-Editor](/scripting/en-script-editor.html) works can be found in the Scripting section.
So also the example for a [Button Script](https://templates.peakboard.com/Script-Example-With-Button/en).
