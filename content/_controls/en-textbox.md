> ## Note!
>
>To display values or KPIs, the [Text Control](/controls/en-text-block.html) should always be used!

In contrast to [Text Control](/controls/en-text-block.html), the Text Box also allows text to be entered. 
These inputs can be further processed with the script type 'ValueChanged'. 
In addition, a 'TappedEvent' can be triggered when the text Box is clicked on by touch or mouse.

Further information on how to create scripts or how the [Script-Editor](/scripting/en-script-editor.html) works can be found in the Scripting section.
