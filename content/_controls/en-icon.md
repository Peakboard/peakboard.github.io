With the help of the icon control, different icons can be integrated into the visualization.
Like any other control, the icon control is dragged and dropped onto the surface (1). 
Afterwards, the [general properties](/controls/en-allgemeine-eigenschaften.html) of the control can be used as usual.
With *Select Icon* the main icon can be determined (2).
The icon dialog that opens allows you to search for a suitable icon.
You can choose from the following collections (3):

* General: Contains general icons
* Logistics: Contains icons from the logistics industry
* SCADA: Contains icons for *Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition* which can be used to adjust and monitor production lines.


In this way a suitable icon can be found with the help of the corresponding search term and the desired collection.
Press OK to confirm the selection.

With *Colors* you can determine a primary and secondary colour for certain icons (4).


If under certain conditions another icon should be displayed (e.g. a warning symbol in case of a machine failure), this can be selected under Conditional Formatting (5).
How the Conditional Formatting works is explained in [this article](https://help.peakboard.com/controls/en-cf.html).
