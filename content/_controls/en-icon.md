With the help of the icon control, different icons can be integrated into the visualization.
Like any other control, the icon control is dragged and dropped onto the user interface (1). 
Afterwards the [general properties](/controls/en-general-properties.html) of the control can be used as usual.
The main icon can be determined via the concatenation symbol (2).
The icon dialog that opens allows you to search for a suitable icon (3).
Here you can choose from the following styles:

> * blue_dark_grey
* dark_gray
* green_dark_grey
> office
* orange_dark_grey
* white
* yellow_dark_grey

This allows you to find a suitable icon using the corresponding search term and the desired style (4).
Click OK to confirm the selection (5).

In addition to the main icon, so-called alternative icons can also be defined (6). 
These in turn can be activated by [Script](/scripting/en-script-engine.html) depending on the situation.
