The TileView Control works in principle exactly the same as the [ListView Control](/controls/10-en-list-view.html). The only difference is the fact that the elements are first arranged from left to right, but then wrapped at the edge into the next “line”. This is suitable for multi-line representations of one and the same element. The example in the screenshot is bound to an Instagram feed as in the other article. However, the template of an element is very simple. It contains only one image at a time.
