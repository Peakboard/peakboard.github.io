The Time Picker is an input control. 
If you include it in a Peakboard visualization, it can be used to select any time of day.

You can connect the Time Picker to a string variable to change the value of the variable. 
You can then use these variables in scripts.
The display format can be set independently of the data format in the Time Picker settings.

For more information on how to create scripts or how the [Peakboard Script Editor](/scripting/en-script-editor.html) works, see the Scripting section.
