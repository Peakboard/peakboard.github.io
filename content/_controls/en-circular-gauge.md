The Circular Gauge Control is very well suited to graphically display a workload.
In addition to the [General Properties](https://help.peakboard.com/controls/en-general-properties.html), the Circular Gauge Control has other properties.

**Data/Value**, **Minimum** and **Maximum** can be linked to a data source.
For example, the maximum utilization of a production plant can be created as **Maximum** and the current utilization as **Data/Value**.
A change is thus directly mapped.

Under the heading **Appearance** the font and appearance of the chart can be adjusted.
The property **Tick Color** allows you to subdivide the circular gauge.
With **Show Value** the numerical value can be shown or hidden.

With [Conditional Formatting](/controls/en-cf.html) the control can be adjusted based on rules.
