In contrast to the webpage Control, the task of the WebWidget Control is to display only an HTML fragment and not a complete page. Typical task is rendering HTML code to integrate external content into your own homepage, e. g. weather, stock prices etc. In the following example we want to integrate the weather widget from [wetter24.de](http://www.wetter24.de/) . You can generate your own HTML code for your postcode by filling in the form on this page.

Open the property editor of the WebWidget control by clicking the small button with the three dots of the HTMLCode property. You can then copy and paste the HTML code into the text field and confirm with OK.

The widget is not displayed in the Designer. To see it, the preview must be activated or the panel must be running on a Peakboard-Box. In the following screenshot you can also see very nicely that the size of the HTML output is determined by the HTML code and not by the size of the control. Of course, the Control must be large enough to display everything.
