The Slider Control can be found under the Input Controls in the Controls list. 
In a visualization it can be used as a slider that takes on a certain value depending on the position of the slider. 
This value can be read out via the variable 'value' of the respective slider. 
In addition, an event can be created for the Slider, called 'ValueChanged', which is executed whenever the slider is moved.

Further information on how to create scripts or how the [Script-Editor](/scripting/en-script-editor.html) works can be found in the Scripting section.
