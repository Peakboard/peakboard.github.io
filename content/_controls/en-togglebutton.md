The Toggle button is located under the Input Controls. 
Two events can be created for it; a checked event, which is executed when the button is clicked, placing it in the enabled position, and an unchecked event, which is executed when the button is clicked a second time, placing it in the disabled position.

More information on how to create scripts or how the [Script-Editor](/scripting/en-script-editor.html) works can be found in the Scripting section.
