The Drop Down Control can be found under the Input Controls in the Controls list. 
The content of the drop down list must come from a table that is linked under Data / Source in the properties of the control. 
For the Drop Down Control an event can be created which is called 'SelectionChanged' and is executed whenever the selection in the Drop Down menu is changed.

Further information on how to create scripts or how the [Script-Editor](/scripting/en-script-editor.html) works can be found in the Scripting section.
