The Control Text is intended to display individual texts or KPIs.
It can also be used to label something. 
The content is set using the Text property. 
All other properties can be found under [General Properties](/controls/en-general-properties.html).

For fonts and colors the [Font Manager](/misc/04-en-fonts.html) can be used.

To format KPIs accordingly, the [Format](/misc/en-formating-values.html) item is located in the control properties.
