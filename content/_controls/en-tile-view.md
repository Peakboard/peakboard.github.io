The TileView control works in principle exactly like the [ListView control](/controls/10-en-list-view.html). The only difference is the fact that the elements are first arranged from left to right, but then wrapped to the next "line" at the edge. This is suitable for multiline representations of one and the same element. As in the other article, the example in the screenshot is bound to an Excel table. The template is identical to that of the [ListView control](/controls/10-en-list-view.html).
Similar to the [ListView control](/controls/10-en-list-view.html), an alternative template with identical rules has also been defined.

The screenshot shows how the data is first arranged from left to right and then into the next line.
