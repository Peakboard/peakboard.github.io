The Linear Gauge Control is very well suited for displaying progress graphically.
In addition to the [General Properties](https://help.peakboard.com/controls/en-general-properties.html), the Linear Gauge Control has other properties.

**Data/Value**, **Minimum** and **Maximum** can be linked to a data source.
For example, the target value of a production plant can be created as **Maximum** and the actual value as **Data/Value**.
A change in the actual value is thus directly mapped.

Under the heading **Appearance**, the font and appearance of the chart can be adjusted.
The **Tick Color** property allows you to subdivide the linear gauge.
With **Show Value** the numerical value can be shown or hidden.

With [Conditional Formatting](/controls/en-cf.html) the control can be adjusted based on rules.
