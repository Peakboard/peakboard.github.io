By means of a visualization on a Peakboard Enterprise Box, the information from the input devices on a Peakboard Edge can be displayed on a screen or stored in a database. At the same time the information can be processed. The output devices on a Peakboard Edge can also be controlled via the visualization. 

The following steps provide an overview of how Peakboard Edge can be used. It is possible to use Peakboard Edge in combination with Peakboard 1 and Peakboard 2.
