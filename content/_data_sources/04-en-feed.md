The feed data source is very simple. It is used to use RSS-Feeds in Peakboard.

To configure it, you just have to enter the feed URL (e. g. [http://www.finanzen.net/rss/Microsoft-RSS-Feed](http://www.finanzen.net/rss/Microsoft-RSS-Feed])). If the feed password is protected, this can be entered using the Authentication attribute. As well as the maximum number of entries to be loaded and the interval for the reload. The columns are fixed and conform to the standard for feeds. The technical details can be found [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS)
