## Manage extensions in the Peakboard Designer
To import an extension into the Designer, go to the administration for the extensions and add the zip-file. Afterwards the Designer must be restarted, then the extension is available and should appear under the data sources. Attention! It is not necessary to modify the Peakboard-Box in any way. The extension is automatically distributed to the box by the deploy process of a board.

## Examples
We have published some extensions in our [Github-Repository](https://github.com/Peakboard/PeakboardExtensions) There are examples as well as extensions for productive use. Especially the examples are kept simple and show the architecture to be used. Every extension in this repo is available in source code (directory SourceCode) and as a prepared zip for installation (binaries).
The github repository can be found [here](https://github.com/Peakboard/PeakboardExtensions).
