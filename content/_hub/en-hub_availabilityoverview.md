In the [Availability Overview] section, you can see the runtimes of all Peakboard Boxes that have been added. 
The timelines of the Peakboard Boxes are green when they are properly accessible. 
Red means that the Peakboard Box is not accessible, grey means that no recording took place, i.e. Peakboard Hub was not active.
