In the Peakboard Hub connection dialog, you must first select (1) whether you want to connect a [Peakboard Hub online](/hub/Peakboard_Hub_online/en-get-started-online.html) or a [Peakboard Hub on premise](/hub/Peakboard_Hub_on_premise/en-get-started.html).
To connect to a Peakboard Hub on premise you have to enter the URL of the Peakboard Hub on premise (incl. http:// or https://) (2). The URL is assigned during [installation](/hub/Peakboard_Hub_on_premise/en-hub_installation.html) If you did not install Peakboard Hub yourself, ask the responsible administrator for the URL.
