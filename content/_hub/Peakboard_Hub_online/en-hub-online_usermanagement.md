It is often necessary that not all users have the same rights. Whether for organizational, data protection or other reasons, you can define who gets which rights in Peakboard Hub online. You define the permissions in Peakboard Hub online via user groups.

You can add Peakboard Boxes (1), lists (2) and connections (3) to a user group.
Using the group key, the members of the user group can then use the Peakboard Hub and access the assigned data. You can find the group key by clicking on the gear icon (4) of the respective user group.

If a Peakboard Box is added to a user group, the users of the respective Peakboard Box will remain.
Define under which Peakboard Box user the Peakboard Hub online user group accesses your Peakboard Box.
This way it is possible that different user groups in Peakboard Hub online use the same Peakboard Box under different Peakboard Box users and thus with different permissions.

For lists, you can configure the permissions per list even more precisely.
To do this, click on the lock symbol (1) in front of the name of the list you want to edit.
You can define if rows can be added or deleted, if the structure of the lists can be changed or if the lists can be cleared completely. In addition, you can assign read-only rights for individual columns. Users can then no longer edit this column.
