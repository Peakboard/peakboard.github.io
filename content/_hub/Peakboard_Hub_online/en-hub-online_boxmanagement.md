To manage your Peakboard Boxes you have to add them to the Peakboard Hub.
The procedure differs depending on whether you use a [Peakboard Hub on premise](/hub/Peakboard_Hub_on_premise/en-hub_boxmanagement.html) or a [Peakboard Hub online](/hub/Peakboard_Hub_online/en-hub-online_boxmanagement.html).
Be sure to use the correct article.

### Adding a Peakboard Box to the Peakboard Hub online

The first step is to connect your Peakboard Boxes to the cloud.
To do this, open the Peakboard Designer and open the Peakboard Box settings (1).

### Manage Peakboard Boxes

In the upper right corner you can now choose in which view your Peakboard Boxes should be displayed.

The list view (1) is recommended if you already have many Peakboard Boxes connected to Peakboard Hub on premise.
It gives you a quick overview of the groups, names and other data of your Peakboard Boxes. However, no screenshots are visible in this view.
To display them, select small (2) or large tiles (3) for viewing. Now you can see at a glance which visualization is currently loaded on the Peakboard Boxes.

Besides the screenshots that are loaded regularly (except in the list view), you will find other elements that the different view types have in common. In the tile view you can click on the magnifying glass icon to enlarge the current screenshot and the reload icon to update the screenshot.
A green circle next to the name of the respective Peakboard Boxes indicates whether it is accessible or not (4). You can see the IP address (5), the user (6) and the version (7) of the respective Peakboard Box at a glance and can restart it by clicking on the [Restart] button (8). By clicking on the [...] icon (9), you can open a context menu that gives you access to further actions. You can update, reset, delete or assign your Peakboard Boxes to a group.

### Peakboard Boxes detail view

Clicking on the name of the Peakboard Boxes or on the screenshot will take you to the detail page of the selected Peakboard Boxes.
The detail page offers two tabs, [Application] (1) and [System] (2).
The application tab shows which visualization is currently displayed.
In the upper area, you can select which visualization should be loaded on the Peakboard Box by clicking on the drop-down menu (3). You can also delete (4) or stop (5) the visualization there. In the lower area you will again find a current screenshot. You can update it by clicking on the corresponding button (6).
