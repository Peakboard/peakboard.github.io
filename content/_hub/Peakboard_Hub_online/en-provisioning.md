## Provisioning

You can access the Peakboard Hub online at [hub.peakboard.com](https://hub.peakboard.com).
To gain access to the Peakboard Hub online, you will need an invitation.
You will receive this invitation after purchasing through our sales or service team.
During the process, you will provide Peakboard with the email address of a future admin user. A message will then be sent to this email address, enabling access for the first admin account.

This account can later add additional users and administrators to the organization in the [user management](/hub/Peakboard_Hub_online/en-hub-online_usermanagement.html) section.
