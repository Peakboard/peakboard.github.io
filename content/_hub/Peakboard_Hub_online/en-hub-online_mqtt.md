Once the Peakboard Designer is connected to Peakboard Hub online, you can easily share a variable with other Peakboard Boxes that will have the same value for that variable.

<div class="box-warning" markdown="1"> **Attention:**
Variables can be shared only in projects with the same Group Key.
</div>

If a Peakboard Box changes the value of a shared variable, it will change for all Peakboard Boxes.

For security reasons, the Peakboard Hub online MQTT server can only be used for the application described.
