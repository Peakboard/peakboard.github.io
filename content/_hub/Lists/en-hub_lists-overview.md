The list view in Peakboard Hub provides a central interface for managing, editing, and controlling your Peakboard Hub lists.

### Sidebar: Navigation and List Overview

In the left sidebar, all created lists are displayed under the menu item [Lists].
Each list has a three-dot menu on the right side, offering additional actions such as deleting, downloading, structure export, or duplicating.

### Main Area: List Contents and Central Control

The main window displays the contents of the selected list.

The toolbar above the list offers the following functions:

- **Add:** Creates new lists or imports existing ones via the dropdown menu.
- **Add row:** Inserts new rows into the current list.
- **List settings:** Opens the editor for list names and columns (including type, default values, and constraints). Changes immediately affect connected scripts when the list is used in Peakboard Designer.
- **Filter:** Defines filtering by column entries using operations like equality, inequality, starts/ends with, and contains. Multiple values separated by semicolons create OR conditions.
- **Sort:** Sets the sort column and direction (ascending/descending).
- **Reload:** Refreshes the list content.
- **Enlarge:** Magnifies the table display.

The context menu on the right side provides the [Clear all data] option for bulk deletion of all list entries.
