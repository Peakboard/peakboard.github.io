### Export Peakboard Hub list

1. **Select Peakboard Hub list:** Click on the desired list under [Peakboard Hub Lists] in the left sidebar.
2. **Open export menu:** Click the three dots next to the list name to open the context menu.
3. **Choose export option:** Two export options are available: **Export Structure** (exports only the structure of the list without contents, suitable when you only need the format as a template) or **Download** (exports the complete list including structure and all contents, suitable for full backups or data transfers).
4. **Start download:** After selecting the desired option, a CSV file is automatically downloaded.

### Import Peakboard Hub list

1. **Open import dialog:** Click the downward arrow next to the [Add] button and select [Import].
2. **Configure import settings:** Fill in the required information in the import dialog: enter a **Name** for the new list and select the mode: **Create** (creates a completely new list), **Append** (adds data to an existing list) or **Override** (completely replaces an existing list).
3. **Select CSV file:** Click [Browse] and select the previously exported CSV file from your computer.
4. **Execute import:** Click [Import] to start the process. A green success message confirms the successful import.

The new list appears in the sidebar and is immediately usable.
