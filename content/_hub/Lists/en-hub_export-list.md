In the previous article you read [how to use a list in the Peakboard Designer](/hub/en-hub_use-list.html).

### Exporting lists

You can also export the lists you have created in Peakboard Hub. There are two different ways to do this.

In the detailed view of your list, you can use [Duplicate Structure] (1) to copy the structure, i.e. the columns and column types of your list for a new list. You get to the creation dialog for a new list that already contains the identical columns and you only have to give it a new name.
Alternatively, you can use [Export Structure] (2) to download a text file that contains the structure of the list as a JSON string.
You can load files of this type into the Peakboard Hub with the [Import] button (3) to create a new list with the identical structure.

To export the contents of your list in its current state, click on [Download Data] (4).
Your data will be made available for download in CSV file format.
It is not possible to import this data back into Peakboard Hub at a later time.
