It is often necessary that not all users have the same rights. Whether for organizational, data protection or other reasons, you can define who gets which rights in Peakboard Hub. You define the permissions in Peakboard Hub via user groups.

<div class="box-warning" markdown="1">
**Note**

The user management is only visible to you if you have admin rights.
</div>

### Add and set up a user group

Click the [Add user group] button (1) and set a name (2) to add a new user group. The group key (3) will be generated automatically.

You can add Peakboard Boxes (1), lists (2) and connections (3) to a user group.
Using the group key (4), the members of the user group can then use Peakboard Hub and access the assigned data.

If a Peakboard Box is added to a user group, the users of the respective Peakboard Box will remain.
Define under which Peakboard Box user the Peakboard Hub user group accesses your Peakboard Box.
This way it is possible that different user groups in Peakboard Hub use the same Peakboard Box under different Peakboard Box users and thus with different permissions.

For lists, you can configure the permissions per list even more precisely.
To do so, click on the pencil button (1) behind the list you want to edit.
You can define if rows can be added or deleted, if the structure of the lists can be changed or if the lists can be cleared completely. In addition, you can assign read-only rights for individual columns. Users can then no longer edit this column.

### Manage individual users

You can assign user groups (1) and change the user status (2) for individual users in the right area of the workspace. There you can also see users that have not yet been assigned to a user group (3) and you can assign them a user group.
