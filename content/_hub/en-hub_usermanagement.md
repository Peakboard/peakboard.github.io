Authorizations take place in Peakboard Hub via user groups. 
User management is visible to you there if you have admin rights. 
If there is no admin yet, you can set it up as described in the [installation](/hub/en-hub_installation.html) article.

You can add Peakboard Boxes, lists and connections to a user group. They can be accessed using the group key.

If a Peakboard Box is added to a user group, the users of the respective Peakboard Box remain. 
Therefore, you have to define under which Peakboard Box user the Peakboard Hub user group accesses your Peakboard Box. 
This way it is possible that different user groups in Peakboard Hub can use the same Peakboard Box under different Peakboard Box users and thus with different permissions.
