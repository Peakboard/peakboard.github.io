In the menu item Connections you can create connections to different data sources and use them in Peakboard Designer.

If the [Peakboard Designer is connected to the Peakboard Hub](/hub/en-hub_connectpbdesigner.html), a connection created here can be loaded in the Peakboard Designer and subsequently used in data sources.
To do this, open the dialog in the Peakboard Designer menu bar under [Connections] (1).

Afterwards, all connections from the Peakboard Hub can be loaded via the button [...] and [Refresh Peakboard Hub connections].

![Update connections](/assets/images/hub/en_hub_connections2.png)

Once this is done, you can use this connection when creating a data source as described [here](/misc/en-shared-connection.html).
