In the Peakboard Hub lists section, you can conveniently browse automatically generated flow lists and link individual values to variables.

### Lists Panel

In the left navigation menu, select the [Lists] section, which displays two main areas: user-defined lists and flow-generated lists.
The [Flow lists] show special lists that are automatically created and populated with data by a flow.
Each flow appears with an expandable arrow showing the associated read-only lists.
Use the search bar to filter lists by name.

### List Data Display

When you select a flow list, a tabular view displays all current entries.
Each row represents a data record, with individual column values visible and selectable as cells.
Flow lists are read-only and serve for viewing and analysis.

### Bind Variable

After selecting a cell, the [Bind to variable] option appears above the table data.
This automatically synchronizes the value of the selected cell with the assigned variable whenever the list changes.
Data integration remains read-only — values cannot be written back to flow lists.
