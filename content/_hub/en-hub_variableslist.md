In the Peakboard Hub you can create lists that you can use in the Peakboard Designer.
These lists offer you the possibility to change data centrally for all Peakboard boxes that use them.
In addition, these lists also offer you the possibility to quickly and easily store data from Peakboard centrally, for example to generate machine statuses for a long-term evaluation.

First click on [Add] (1) in the [Lists] section and create a data structure.
Here you define your columns of your list (2).

In the next area you have the possibility to enter data for this list.

Once the list is created and your [Peakboard Designer is connected to Peakboard Hub](/hub/en-hub_connectpbdesigner.html), you can include it in Peakboard Designer via the [Peakboard Hub List](/data_sources/en-peakboard-hub-list.html) data source.

If you want to write data back to the Peakboard Hub list, you can do this in the Peakboard Designer script editor.
