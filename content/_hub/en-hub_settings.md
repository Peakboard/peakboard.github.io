On the settings page you can perform different settings for the Peakboard Hub. 
This page can only be reached if the current user is defined as admin via the Database Manager in the installation folder of the Peakboard Hub. 
You can find this by default under c:/inetpub/PeakboardHub/Peakboard.HUB.DatabaseManager.exe.

The following settings can be made here:
* Automatic updates of the Peakboard Boxes, as well as the path where the update file should be saved. The update always refers to the update on the Peakboard Hub server. You can get the current update here: https://peakboard.com/download/runtime/Peakboard.Runtime_Update.pbux
* Email settings, if a notification should be sent when the status of a Peakboard Box changes (e.g. box has gone offline).
* MQTT Server Settings for communication of Peakboard boxes via Peakboard Hub.
