### Activate push notifications

1. **Open alerts page and subscribe:** Open the Alerts page in Peakboard Hub. In the right panel, find the [Push Notifications] section with the status [Not Subscribed]. Click [Subscribe to Alerts] to activate notifications. The subscription must be made on the device that will receive the notifications (Windows, MacOS, Android, or iOS).
2. **Grant browser permission:** The browser will prompt you via a popup to allow notifications. Click [Allow] to enable push notifications. This permission is mandatory.

### Send and test alert

After successful setup, you can test the function by sending an alert from your visualization.
The alert will be displayed both in Peakboard Hub and as a Windows notification via the notification center.

To deactivate push notifications, click [Unsubscribe from Alerts] in the same section.
