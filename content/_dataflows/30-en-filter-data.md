The Dataflow step "Filter" is a powerful tool for deleting unneeded data according to a certain logic. For example, if you receive warehouse transaction data from a source system for two storage locations, but want to look at both areas separately (for example, with a key figure for one area and the other separately), you would typically create two data flows and delete the data for the other area using a filter right at the beginning. This turns a mixed data source into two separate data sources.

The logic works with a Lua expression like in the *Create Colum* step. Only the return value changes. If the expression returns *false*, the line is deleted, if it returns *true*, it remains in the resultset. The following example shows how to delete all rows that contain the value "N/A" in the *City* column.
