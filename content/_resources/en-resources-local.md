Local resources are static files that are inserted directly from the file system and are then no longer changed.

Many different file types are accepted. These can be files that are only displayed, such as images or PDFs. However, files that contain data, such as Excel files, can also be added statically in order to process them further with [Dataflows](/dataflows/en-getting-started.html) or similar.

### Add local resource

To add a local resource, right-click on [Resources] and click on [Add local resource] (1).

![Add local resource](/assets/images/resources/en_resources-local-01.png)

The selection dialog opens in which you select your desired file and add it with [Open].
You will then find the file in the Explorer in the [Resources] area, where you can organize them into folders if required. When you save your project, the resource is also saved. If you open your project on another system, the resource will still be available there.

You can edit (1), copy (2) or delete (3) the local resource with a right-click, download it to the current system in its current state (4) or display where you are currently using the resource in your project (5).
