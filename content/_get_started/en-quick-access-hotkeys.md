The quick access bar and hotkeys both aim to improve the user experience in the Peakboard Designer and increase efficiency.

## The quick access bar

The quick access bar allows you to access the most frequently used functions and tools in one easily accessible location. This saves time as you don't have to navigate through menus to access these functions.
If you are new to Peakboard Designer, the quick access bar can serve as a helpful guide to quickly learn and use basic and important functions. This way you can reduce your learning curve when familiarizing yourself with the Peakboard Designer.

### Using the quick access bar

To access the quick access bar, use the hotkeys [Ctrl + K] or click on the corresponding Magnifier icon (1) in the menu bar. You will find a list of other hotkeys in the Peakboard Designer in the second part of this article.

The quick access bar appears at the top of the workspace. It is divided into two areas. A scrollable menu area (1) with all available functions and the search bar (2) with which you can search through the functions.

The quick access bar provides many different functions of the Peakboard Designer.
You can add data sources, controls, dataflows, variables, resources or screens to your current project or delete existing elements by entering the corresponding keyword, for example [add JSON] and clicking on the function or pressing the [Enter] key. The corresponding dialog for adding is displayed automatically when you click or confirm with the [Enter] key.

The quick access bar expands automatically when elements are added with options that match the existing elements in the project. Unused data sources, resources or variables can also be displayed via the quick access bar.

In addition to adding and removing elements and their element-specific options, you can also access all menu bar options via the quick access bar. You can open new projects, save the current project, make settings for the Peakboard Designer or your project, open the font manager or the project colors and access the settings of your Peakboard Boxes, Peakboard Edge or Peakboard Hub.

## Hotkeys

Hotkeys, also known as keyboard shortcuts, are also designed to improve your user experience by making the Peakboard Designer more efficient and faster to use.

While the quick access bar allows you to quickly access the functions of the Peakboard Designer by typing and clicking with the mouse, hotkeys offer the possibility to perform some actions even faster via the keyboard by complementing the graphical user interface, which also includes the quick access bar. Some hidden options for which there is no menu item can also be executed via hotkeys. This can save time, especially for advanced users or those who prefer to use the mouse even less.

For users with physical limitations or those who have difficulty with precise mouse control, hotkeys can provide a more accessible way to utilize Peakboard Designer's features and expand accessibility.
While the Quick Access Bar is intuitive and easier for beginners to learn, hotkeys require a certain amount of learning and familiarization.

### Using hotkeys

Hotkeys can be found in various areas of the Peakboard Designer. They are often listed in the context menu behind the respective options (1).
