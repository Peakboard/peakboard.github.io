The Peakboard Designer is a desktop application for Windows computers that you can [download here](https://peakboard.com/en/peakboard-designer/?utm_source=HelpCenter&utm_medium=Link&utm_campaign=GetStarted_Article).
You may need installation permissions from your system administrator to install it.

In this article we will give you a first overview of Peakboard Designer. In the following articles you will create your first visualization and transfer it to your Peakboard Box.
Our [video tutorials](/tutorials/en-video-overview.html) also offer you further assistance, feel free to have a look around.

# 1. Welcome to the Peakboard Designer

After opening Peakboard Designer for the first time, you will find yourself in the start dialog.
Here you will find useful links to the Peakboard Help (1) or the video tutorials.
Via the button [Templates] (2) you will find some templates, which should make the start as easy as possible.
The templates serve as examples and can be used as a basis for your individual visualization.
The button [Script templates] (3) gives you access to templates for different use cases and example files that explain how to work with scripts.
To start your visualization without a template, select [Empty file] in the [Start from scratch] area (4).

# 2. The structure of the Peakboard Designer

Now you've really arrived at the Peakboard Designer.
The Peakboard Designer is divided into five main areas.
At the top is the menu bar (1), on the left is the explorer (2), the workspace is in the middle (3), the various controls are on the right (4) and below that are the attributes (5).

## 2.1 The menu bar 

In the menu bar you will find basic functions of the Peakboard Designer.
Open a preview of your visualization (1) and load it onto your Peakboard Box (2).
Use the [Project] button (3) to make basic settings for your visualization and the [General] button (4) to perform a software update, for example.
You can manage your Peakboard Boxes and Peakboard Edge via the corresponding buttons (5).

## 2.2 The explorer

In the folder structure of the explorer all data sources, dataflows, variables, scripts and resources are displayed.
In the last section [Screens] you will find a list of all existing visual controls on your workspace.
Since we have not added any controls yet, the folders are empty at the moment.

With a right click on the folders you can perform different actions - alternatively this also works with a click on [...].
For example, open the menu item [Edit screen size] with a right click on [Screens] to define the size of the visualization.
For our example it is best to leave it at 1920x1080 (Full HD).
The visualization will be automatically scaled to the resolution of the connected screen, but the aspect ratio should be correct.

## 2.3 The controls 

For the different use cases you will find pre-built interface elements, which we call controls. They can be used and customized to visualize your data.
From simple text fields, tables, simple charts like bar charts or pie charts, to sophisticated, combinable charts (Advanced charts) and repeatable interface patterns like the list or tile view, everything is available to you.
Either drag and drop the elements onto the workspace or add them with a double click.

## 2.4 The attributes

Below the controls you will find the attribute overview.
Here the respective adjustable parameters and attributes are listed for the currently active control. 
These parameters are different for each control.
For example, try adding another screen by right-clicking on [Screens] in the Explorer. 
Now click on one of the screens and set the [Display duration] in the attributes under [General].
This display duration defines how long the respective screen remains visible before the next one is displayed.
