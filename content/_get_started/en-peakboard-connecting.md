This tutorial shows you how to put your Peakboard Box into operation and transfer your data visualization.
Also, watch our video for more tips on [how to transfer a visualization to the Peakboard Box](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx5paqL41Qo).
If you have not already done so, we recommend reading the tutorial [Getting Started â€“ the Basics](/tutorials/01-en-peakboard-designer-basics.html) to get started with the Peakboard Designer.

Power your Peakboard Box via micro-USB to put it into operation. 
The monitor is controlled with an HDMI cable and if the WiFi is not configured yet, you will need a LAN cable for the Peakboard Box.

As soon as it is powered up, the [Windows 10 IoT Enterprise](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/windows/iot-core/windows-iot-enterprise) operating system on the Peakboard Box will boot and the Peakboard logo will be displayed on the monitor for a few seconds. 
After a few further seconds, the Peakboard Box is ready for operation.

To transfer a dashboard to the Peakboard Box, first click on [Manage / Upload] in the ribbon bar of the Peakboard Designer.
How to add a new Peakboard Box is explained [here](/administration/07-de-hinzufuegen.html).
After the Peakboard Box has been added, mark it with a mouse click (1) and load the visualization onto the Peakboard Box by clicking [Deploy] (2).

If the transfer was successful and no other dashboard is already active, the data visualization is displayed directly on the monitor. 
*Note:* Each Peakboard Box can store multiple dashboards, but only one of the dashboards can be active at a time.
