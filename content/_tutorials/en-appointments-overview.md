In order to get into the creation of a welcome screen as simple as possible, we offer ready-made templates. This is a step by step guide on how to create your personal welcome screen with these templates. For a general introduction to Peakboard, see the [first steps](https://peakboard.rocks/get-started). If you would like to know how to connect a peakboard box to your designer and transfer a visualization, please read the following [article](https://peakboard.rocks/connect). To create a visualization you need the Peakboard Designer. This can be downloaded [for free](https://peakboard.rocks/designer-from-welcome-en).

## Appointment overview with Office 365 calendar as data source

This visualization can accommodate up to six appointments. The appointments are managed via a simple Microsoft Office 365 calendar connection. It supports Microsoft Office 365 accounts and modern (on-premise) Exchange servers that support Microsoft Graph.

## Additional templates for welcome screens

The following templates offer an alternative to the schedule overview described here. A detailed description of the templates can be found [here](https://peakboard.rocks/welcome).

### Simple board with one appoinment

![image_live](/assets/images/instant_boards/welcome/Welcome_Screen_Online_Single.jpg)

You can load this visualization on the Peakboard Box, the box does not necessarily need an internet connection. Without an internet connection, external sources such as the weather widget can not be added. This board offers the possibility to display a maximum of one appointment from a table data source.

### Multiple appointments managed with a table

![image_live](/assets/images/instant_boards/welcome/Welcome_Screen_Online.jpg)

You can load this visualization on the Peakboard Box, the box does not necessarily need an internet connection. Without an internet connection, external sources such as the weather widget can not be used. The board can display up to three appointments. The appointments are stored and managed in a table directly on the Peakboard Box. [Download Link](https://github.com/Peakboard/CoolStuff/raw/master/Demonstrator/Designer%20Templates/Administration/Welcome%20Screen%20Online/Welcome_Screen_Online.pbmx)

### Multiple appointments with MS Office 365 calendar as data source

![image_live](/assets/images/instant_boards/welcome/Welcome_Screen_Online.jpg)

Optically identical to the previous board. The appointment management does not happen on the box, but works with a Microsoft Office calendar. It supports Microsoft Office 365 accounts and modern (on-premise) Exchange servers that support Microsoft Graph. Access to the calendar must be made via Microsoft, then automatically up to three current appointments are displayed. [Download Link](https://github.com/Peakboard/CoolStuff/raw/master/Demonstrator/Designer%20Templates/Administration/Welcome%20Screen%20Calendar/Welcome_Screen_Calendar.pbmx)

## Initial configuration

The initial configuration is a one-time process and is necessary to adapt the general design such as logo, background and weather widget to your needs. If the visualization is right for you, just upload it to your Peakboard Box and you can focus on appointment management.

### Set up time server

This setting defines from which data source the Peakboard Box obtains the current time. You can leave the default setting, this invokes the following service for the time: 'time.windows.com'. If you want to use your local time server of your network, you can change it by navigating to the 'Settings' -> 'Time server' tab in the top menu bar. Especially if the box has no Internet connection, it is important to deposit the local time server. Just ask your administrator for the address.

### Update weather widget

If you do not want to use this weather widget, you can simply clear the element from the visualization in the Peakboard Designer. Select it with a right-click and choose 'Delete'.

If you want to use the Weather Widget, you can create your own widget with your city at the following address: [https://weatherwidget.io/](https://weatherwidget.io/).

First select the city in which the board should later hang. You can then define further parameters such as language, the texts to be displayed and the unit.
On the other tabs there are many more ways to customize the weather widget to your needs.

For our visualization we have used the font 'Arial' in the tab 'Options', the icon Set 'Climacons Animated', Forecast Days '3'.
As theme, we used the theme 'Pure' under 'Flat'.

If you are satisfied with your options, you can click on the 'Get Code' button. In the opened window you will now find the finished code for your personal widget. Copy this code by marking it or just click on the 'Copy to Clipboard' button.

Now go back to the Peakboard Designer and select the control 'Web widget (Weather)' in the sidebar or click directly on the weather widget.

In the further sidebar on the right side you will find some parameters for this element. Click on the '...' button under 'HTML code' (2). In the opened window you can now replace the existing code with your created code (3). Insert your created widget there and click on the OK button.

### Update logo

To replace the Peakboard logo with your desired company logo, you need an image file. Different formats are supported (PNG, JPG). Simply drag and drop the desired image file onto the left sidebar of the Peakboard Designer. Then you will find the image file in the sidebar under the item 'Resources'. Now drag this image file to the current logo, so you can overwrite it. Then you can make adjustments to optimize size and position.

### Define default texts

The visualization comes with ready-made texts for the situation that there is no appointment to display.
You can adapt these texts via the variable list 'text_labels'. These changes can be made directly in the Peakboard Designer by double-clicking on the list and clicking on 'Edit' in the dialog. 

Alternatively, you can use the web interface if you already have a box. This web interface is a web page that you can be accessed by clicking on 'Manage / Upload' in the Peakboard Designer 'Home' tab. In the dialog, select the desired box (you must have already loaded the visualization onto a box). Now click on the button 'Webinterface' (1). You can learn more about the webinterface on [this page](https://peakboard.rocks/webinterface).

![image_live](/assets/images/instant_boards/welcome/Manage_Dialog_Webinterface_Button_en.png)

Alternatively, you can also call the web interface directly in your browser with the URL: http://NameYourBox:40404. You must enter the name of your box followed by the port :40404. Login requires the login data supplied with the box. Then you will see a screenshot of your currently running visualization and on the right side (2) various variable lists which you can now change. You can change all displayed source texts in the variable list 'text_labels'. 

![image_live](/assets/images/instant_boards/welcome/Webinterface_Overview.png)

For example, change the greeting text (2) and save it with a click on 'Update'. With the Refresh button you can load a new screenshot of your visualization (3).

That's it, you have customized your visualization to your needs. Now you have to upload the visualization to your Peakboard Box. To do this, go to the menu ribbon at the top under the tab 'Home' to the point 'Manage / Upload'. In the following dialog, select your box and click on 'Upload'. Now the visualization is loaded onto your box, after a short time the visualization should be visible on the screen that is connected to the Peakboard Box. If you are satisfied with the result, you can then concentrate on the appointment management. If you have not yet connected your Peakboard Box, it is best to read the following [article](https://peakboard.rocks/connect).

## Manage appointments

To be able to use the [visualization with calendar attachment] (https://github.com/Peakboard/CoolStuff/raw/master/Demonstrator/Designer%20Templates/Administration/Welcome%20Screen%20Calendar/Welcome_Screen_Calendar.pbmx), you must contact us Register your private - or better yet a shared - calendar account into your Microsoft account and activate a share for the necessary information for Peakboard.

Open the visualization file with the Peakboard Designer. Now you can open the calendar data source in the left sidebar (Visualization -> Data -> Calendar). Under the second item 'Authorization status', you must now set up a share for your calendar via the 'Authorize' button. To do this, follow the Windows logon steps and allow Peakboard to access the calendar. Once the authorization has been granted, you can close the dialog with OK, save the visualization. Now upload the current visualization to your Peakboard Box.

Subsequently, all current appointments are automatically fetched from the specified Microsoft calendar and displayed up to three. This means that you can simply manage the appointments in your calendar as usual and Peakboard automatically fetches the relevant appointments and presents them. If there is no other appointment for today, the general welcome text from the list 'text_labels' is used.

Peakboard currently supports Microsoft Office 365 accounts and modern on-premise Exchange servers supporting Microsoft Graph. It's best to ask your admin.
