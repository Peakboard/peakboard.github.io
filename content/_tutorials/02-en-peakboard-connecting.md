This tutorial shows you how to put the Peakboard-Box into operation and transfer its first design to the box. If you haven’t read it yet, we recommend the basics tutorial for an introduction to the designer:

[Peakboard Designer: The Basics](/tutorials/01-en-peakboard-designer-basics.html)

To put the Peakboard-Box into operation, it must be powered by a Micro-USB cable. The monitor is controlled with a standard HDMI cable and as long as the WiFi is not configured, the box needs a LAN cable.

As soon as the box is powered, the Windows 10 IoT operating system boots on the box (recognized by the Windows logo that appears on the monitor for a few seconds during the boot process). After a few more seconds the box is ready for operation and waits to receive and display a design.

From the designer’s point of view, we now want to transfer a board to the box. To do this, click the Manage button in the toolbar. To add a new box, please click [here](/administration/07-de-hinzufuegen.html). After you have added the box, select it with a simple mouse click (1). Then load the board onto the box by clicking Deploy (2).

After successful transfer, the board should also be displayed on the monitor, unless another board has already been running. This will then of course not be switched off. Each box can store any number of boards, but only one can be active.
