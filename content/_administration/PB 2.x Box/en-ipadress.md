The manual setting of the IP address of a peakboard box is only possible if there is a direct connection to the box.

It is best to use an Ethernet cable for this.



To change the IP address of the box, it is important that it has been added in the Designer. 
You can see how this works in [this Article](https://help.peakboard.com/administration/PB%202.x%20Box/en-adding.html) article.


 
After the box has been added, double click on it in the Administration / Upload dialog (1) to open the Peakboard Box Settings (2).

In this dialog, the button next to the Box IP entry can be used to open an additional mask (3).
All connections for which an IP address can be set are displayed here.
Now you only have to select the desired connection via IP configuration (4) 
and then change the IP address or DNS server address (5).
