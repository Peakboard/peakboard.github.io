To define proxy settings for the Designer, the Manage dialog (2) for the Peakboard Box must first be opened under the Home menu tab (1). 
Here under Proxy Settings (3) you can define if a proxy connection should be used and if necessary the access data for this can be entered.

If the Peakboard Box is to communicate via a proxy connection, this must be specified in the box settings (4). 
For this purpose there is the item Proxy Server in the Connection Setting (5), which provides a mask for entering the address and bypass list. 
Furthermore you can define if the proxy server should be activated and if the entries should not be used for local addresses (6).
