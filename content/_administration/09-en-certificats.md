First, the certificate must exist as a file on the file system.

The easiest way to save it is for example from Chrome.



Go to the https page there; Ctrl+Shift+I and then display the certificate in the “Security” tab.

From there you can save to a file in the tab “Details”. `DER( *.cer )` is sufficient for this case.

Copy the exported file to the device.

To do this, access the admin share \\\<ip>\c$ in Windows Explorer and store it in the folder c:\users\public\, for example.

Enter the user name and password of the administrator.

Then connect to the device via PowerShell.

Running a PowerShell locally as an administrator

* net start WinRM
* Set-Item WSMan:\localhost\Client\TrustedHosts -Value <ip-address>
* Enter-PSSession -ComputerName <ip address> -Credential localhost\administrator
When connected, import the certificate into the certificate store:
* $cert = “c:\users\public\demo.cer”
* Import Certificate -FilePath $cert -CertStoreLocation Cert:\LocalMachine\Root

Now the certificate should automatically be classified as trustworthy when invoked.

However, the prerequisite is that it is otherwise a correctly issued certificate, i.e. it must no longer have been created with SHA-1 and the host name of the server from the URL must match the name in the certificate.
