If you are planing to use Sharepoint as a Peakboard data source, you need to add the Peakboard App to your Office 365 apps.

To learn how to add an app to your Office365 apps, visit [the Microsoft Azure website](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/grant-admin-consent#construct-the-url-for-granting-tenant-wide-admin-consent).

Administrative permissions for Microsoft Azure are required for the installation.
Also, the client ID of the Peakboard app is required for this.
