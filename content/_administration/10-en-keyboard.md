By default, a “QWERTY” keyboard layout is used in Windows IoT Core.

The easiest way to change the layout is as follows:

1. Create a board with a control that contains a text input field. In our screenshot, for example, the Google website was used.

2. Then connect a mouse (alternatively also via touch screen) to the Peakboard box and click in the input field.

3. This opens the on-screen keyboard.

5. Now you can select the appropriate layout. This setting also applies to keyboards connected via USB and will be kept when rebooting.
