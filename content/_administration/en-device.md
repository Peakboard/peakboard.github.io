First, connect your Peakboard Box with a network cable and the included Wi-Fi USB adapter. 
As soon as the connection to the network is initially set up, an IP address should be displayed on the connected display. 

Now start the Peakboard Designer and [add the Peakboard Box](/administration/PB%202.x%20Box/en-adding.html).
