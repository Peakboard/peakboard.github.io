A new window will open. 
If the Peakboard Box you want to update is not in the list, you can see here [how to add a Peakboard Box to the Peakboard Designer](/administration/07-en-adding.html).

You can update one or more Peakboard Boxes at the same time, simply select the Peakboard Boxes you want to update.

### This is how you update your Peakboard Boxes

If the workspace with the Peakboard Designer has an active internet connection, the update can be executed by clicking on [Update].
 
If, on the other hand, this workstation is in an isolated network, the update is done by using the update file. 
[Download the update file here](https://peakboard.com/download/runtime/Peakboard.Runtime_Update.pbux) and make it available to the Peakboard Designer via network drive or USB stick. 
Lastly, start the update via [Update from File].
