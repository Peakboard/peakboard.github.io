In this dialog all Peakboard Boxes in the network are displayed.
Simply mark the desired Peakboard Box by clicking on it (3) and fill in the fields username (4) and password (5).
After confirming with OK your Peakboard Box will be added to the Peakboard Designer.

Alternatively, you can add your boxes from the Peakboard Hub by clicking on the Peakboard Hub Synchronize button (6).

This requires an installed [Peakboard Hub](/hub/en-hub_installation.html) where boxes have already been added.
