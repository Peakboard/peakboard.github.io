One of the basic ideas behind Peakboard is that you, the end-user, do not need to have any programming knowledge.

Based on this idea, the [dataflows](/dataflows/en-getting-started.html) allow you to perform a variety of functions that would normally require scripting.

However, you will need some scripts to e.g.

* create interactivity (e.g. with a touchscreen)
* [filter data in a dataflow](/dataflows/en-filter-and-sort.html)
* Create complex rules for formatting and displaying text
* Write information back to a database or to SAP

The basic scripting language in the Peakboard Designer is Lua, there are plenty of documentation and tutorials available on the internet for this.
In the Peakboard Designer, Lua can use the data types, string, number and boolean.
You can also create your own functions.

A very detailed documentation can be found, for example, on [lua.org](https://www.lua.org/docs.html).
To learn how to use Lua scripts in the Peakboard Designer, see the subsequent articles.
