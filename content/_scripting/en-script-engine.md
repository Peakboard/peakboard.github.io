One of the basic ideas behind Peakboard is that the end-user does not need to have any programming knowledge.

Based on this idea, the [Dataflows](/dataflows/en-getting-started.html) provide a variety of functions that would normally require scripts.

Nevertheless, some scripts are needed, e.g. to

* to generate interactivity (e.g. with a touch screen)
* [to filter Data in a dataflow](/dataflows/en-filter-data.html)
* create complex rules for formatting and displaying text
* write information to a database or back to SAP

 
The basic scripting language is Lua, there are numerous documentations and tutorials on the internet.
In Lua the data types String, Number and Boolean can be used.
You can also create your own functions.

A very nice documentation can be found on [this website](https://www.lua.org/docs.html).
