In this scripting example the structure of a very simple calculator is explained, which can add and subtract.


![image_1](/assets/images/scripting/Scripting_Beispiele/Taschenrechner.png)

The numbers to be calculated are entered in the left and right text fields.
Using the button which is currently set to "+", the type of calculation can be determined:

```lua
if screens['Screen1'].PlusMinus.text == '+' then 
	screens['Screen1'].PlusMinus.text = '-'
else
	screens['Screen1'].PlusMinus.text = '+'
end

```

Therefore it is checked which text is monentan in the button (which PlusMinus is called). If the text is '+', it is set to '-'.
If the text is not '+' it must be '-', so it is set to'+' without checking.

Click the "Click me" button to start the calculation:

```lua 
local result = 0 
--Check the text in the plus minus button
	
if screens['Screen1'].PlusMinus.text == '+' then 
	result = tonumber(screens['Screen1'].Left.text) + tonumber(screens['Screen1'].Right.text) 
else
	result = tonumber(screens['Screen1'].Left.text) - tonumber(screens['Screen1'].Right.text)
end

-- Show the result in a dialog 
screens['Screen1'].showdialog('Result', result)	

```

First a local variable is created for the result `local result`. Then the PlusMinus button is used to determine whether the numbers in the two text fields should be added or subtracted.
The result of this calculation in the script is then written to the local variable 'result' and last displayed on the screen via `screens['Screen1'].showdialog('Result', result)` As pop-up notification
