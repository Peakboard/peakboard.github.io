To create complex [Lua-Scripts](/scripting/en-script-engine.html) an editor is necessary. The Designer provides its own script editor for this purpose. 

The following illustration illustrates this editor using the example of a timer script.

The structure is for the scripts [Timer](/scripting/en-script-types.html), [Global Function](/scripting/en-script-types.html), [Global Events](/scripting/en-script-types.html),[On Screen Activation](/scripting/en-script-types.html), [On Data Update](/scripting/en-script-types.html) or [For Controls](/scripting/en-script-types.html).

Above the script tree on the right side (1) there is a button for out and a button for commenting.

The magnifying glass is the third button that symbolizes the Search, Search and Replace function, which can also be called using the key combination Ctrl+F.

The script tree (2) contains the elements Timer, Types, Runtime as well as some of the most frequently used functions. A detailed overview can be found [here](/scripting/en-script-tree.html).

The tree on the left side (3) allows you to navigate through the different scripts without leaving the editor. A detailed overview of the scripts can be found [here](/scripting/en-script-types.html).

In the middle area (4) you can enter the script.

With the help of the validation function (5) the created script can be checked for its correctness.
