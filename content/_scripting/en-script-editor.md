For complex [Lua scripts](/scripting/en-script-engine.html), the Peakboard Designer provides its own script editor. 
In the following picture, you can see how the Peakboard Script Editor looks like, using a timer script as an example. 
However, the structure is almost identical for [all Peakboard script types](/scripting/en-script-types.html).

Above the script tree on the right side (1) there is a button to [comment out] and a button for [uncommenting]. 

The magnifying glass leads you to the search, where you can [find] and [replace] elements. [Ctrl+F] also works. 

The [script tree](/scripting/en-script-tree.html) (2) contains the predefiened elements of the Peakboard Designer explorer (like, [Data], [Variable], [Dataflows], [Screens] and [Ressources]) as well as [timers], [types], [runtime] and some of the most frequently used functions.
Last but not least you will find here your previously created and [shared connections](/misc/en-shared-connection.html).

Using the folders on the left (3) you can navigate through the [different scripts](/scripting/en-script-types.html) without leaving the editor.  

After you have entered the script in the middle of the script editor (4), you can check if it is correct via [Validate] (5). 

If your script does not work correctly, you can debug it with the debugger (6).
