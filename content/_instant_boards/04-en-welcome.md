This Plug & Play solution, which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/Peakboard/CoolStuff/tree/master/Business/Welcome%20with%20APP), offers a way to implement a welcome screen without much effort.

The basis for this is a variable list, which can be filled by the user (1).
For each entry in the list, the [ListView-Controls](/controls/10-en-list-view.html) visualizes a corresponding entry(2).
The example company logo can be easily exchanged as known (3).
The date (4) as well as the two web widgets (5) for the analogue clock and the weather display provide additional information.
The following screenshot illustrates the core elements of this instant board.

With the help of a time comparison, those entries are highlighted that fulfill the set condition.
In this example, a stylized male indicates whether someone is visiting in the selected period.

New entries can be made in the following ways:

Use the Peakboard Mobil App for iOS and Android, which can be downloaded from the Google or Apple Store. 
More information about our App can be found [here](/instant_boards/02-en-app.html).

Access via web browser. Further information on entering variables or lists via the browser can be found [here](/instant_boards/03-en-web.html).

The following screenshot shows the visualization with three example data sets.
