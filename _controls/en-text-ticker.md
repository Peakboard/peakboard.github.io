The Text Ticker Control is intended to display a scrolling text. Please note the following general additional information:

[General Properties]()

[Managing font formats with Font Manager]()

[Scripts in dynamic properties]()

The content is set using the Text property. The text property is usually bound to a source or set dynamically in the script. Please note that the bound data source can be either a single string or a table. In the case of the table, the first column is always taken from each row and added to the table for display.
The Rate property defines the running speed; Direction defines the direction.
