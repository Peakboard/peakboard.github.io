To set up the Wi-Fi of the Peakboard-Box, it must first be connected to a network cable and the supplied Wi-Fi USB adapter must be connected.
If the Peakboard-Box is still in initial state, an IP address should be displayed on the screen as soon as the connection to the network has been established.

You should now be able to connect to the Windows IoT administration interface of the Peakboard-Box via the following URL:
http://[BoxName]:8080 
The box name is printed on the peakboard box and could be PB1234, for example.
In this case the correct URL would be http://PB1234:8080

You can now expand the Connectivity menu item on the left-hand side and then select Network.
You should find a list of all available Wi-Fi networks there.

Select the one you want and enter the Wi-Fi key.

It is important that you then restart the box using the power button so that the changes are retained.
